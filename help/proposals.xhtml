<h1>Proposed Features</h1>

<h2>Character encoding</h2>

<p>International text will be supported, but only via UTF-8. It has become the
only sensible encoding, being
plain-text compatible, supporting all human languages, and allowing documents
with mixed languages. There is no reliable way to detect what encoding is used
in a file, making it <em>impossible</em> to support other encodings in a fully
automatic way. In any case, supporting other encodings would delay the desirable
adoption of UTF-8 everywhere. So files must be converted to UTF-8 where
necessary before being edited by <mark>Snipe</mark>.</p>

<h2>New file</h2>

<p>When a new file is created, its filename is requested straight away, instead
of creating an anonymous buffer. This is partly to be compatible with the no
buffer convention. But it is also because otherwise the editor doesn't know the
file extension and so can't do syntax highlighting of the text etc.</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>A separate settings file, perhaps <code>.snipe</code> is supported in any
directory. A search is made in ancestor directories, so that a single settings
file can apply to a multi-directory project. A check is made that the file is
within the user's home area, to guard against security threats.</p>

<h2>Double clicking</h2>

<p>Conventional double clicks are time-dependent. That means they are unreliable
when a slow computer or slow network connection interferes with the timings of
the clicks. They are also inaccessible to people who have difficulty in
clicking fast enough. So in Snipe a double click means exactly the same as two
single clicks.</p>

<p>The common effect of double or triple clicking to select a word or line can
still be achieved. A click at the same place as the existing cursor causes
a word to be selected. A click within an existing selection causes it to be
extended to the whole line. Within a directory listing, a click on a file name
which is already selected causes the file to be opened.</p>

<h2>Auto Semicolons</h2>

<p>Semicolons are inserted or corrected automatically on every edit, in a
similar fashion to indenting. This is more language-dependent than indenting,
and requires some support from language scanning.</p>

<h2>Multiple cursors</h2>

<p>Multiple cursors are too cool to leave out of <mark>Snipe</mark>. They are
coming soon.</p>

<h2>Compile and Run</h2>

<p>On pressing <code>CTRL+S</code> for example, the file is saved, and a
pre-defined command or command sequence issued to compile and/or run the
program. This should be within an existing terminal window that the programmer
is already using, with a preferred environment, and which <mark>Snipe</mark> was
started up from.</p>

<h2>Scrolling</h2>

<p>Scrolling by grabbing a bar with the mouse, and some kind of equivalent
using the keyboard, will be implemented. This will probably use a
(semi-)transparent overlayed bar rather
than permanently stealing space from the text, and much larger than usual to
make an easy target for the mouse. Line numbers should also be visible as an
overlay.</p>

<h2>Line numbers</h2>

<p>To go straight to a specific line number, the CTRL key is held down while the
digits are typed. A line number overlay, and perhaps scrolling overlay, is
displayed during the operation.</p>
