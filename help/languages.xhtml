<h1>Languages</h1>

<p><mark>Snipe</mark> has a scanner which is implemented as a string-matching
state machine to divide the text of a file being edited into tokens, and to give
each token a type. The resulting tokens support  syntax highlighting, and
further editor features such as bracket matching and indenting.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>A scanner for an editor has different goals from those of a scanner in a
compiler. On the one hand the scanner:</p>

<ul>
<li>may omit some details needed only for full compiling</li>
<li>may accept some tokens that a compiler would reject</li>
<li>may split or classify tokens differently</li>
<li>may be approximate</li>
</ul>

<p>One common reason for a scanner to be approximate is that the lexical rules
for a language depend on syntactic context. A multi-language editor doesn't
normally support full parsing of languages. Another common reason is that a
language allows multi-line comments to nest. A state machine can't model
unlimited nesting, but can implement nesting to a small fixed maximum level. On
the other hand, the scanner:</p>

<ul>
<li>must include all characters, including comments, in tokens</li>
<li>must be able to handle any text, whether valid or not</li>
<li>must produce token types suitable for syntax highlighting</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the scanner for Snipe is designed to be able to support other
editor features such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>incremental rescanning</li>
<li>cursor movement a 'word' at a time</li>
<li>line wrapping</li>
<li>bracket matching</li>
<li>indenting</li>
<li>semicolon insertion</li>
</ul>

<p>The snipe scanner is a generic table-driven state machine. Each language has
a description in a text file, which is compiled into a table. Further languages
can be supported by adding description files.</p>

<h2>Language description files</h2>

<p>Language tokens are described by a plain text file. For example, the C
language is described by the <code>tokens.txt</code> file in the directory
<code>snipe/languages/c</code>. The file is a description of a string-matching
state machine. A generic scanner uses the state machine to generate a tag byte
for every byte of text.</p>

<p>The format of language description files is fairly simple. A line which is
blank or begins with a symbol such as <code>#</code> or <code>//</code> is a
comment line which is ignored. Otherwise, a line represents a string-matching
rule.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>A simple rule has a base state name, a list of patterns to match, a target
state name, and a token type, all separated by spaces. A state name begins with
a lower case letter. A pattern is a sequence of non-space characters. A token
type starts with an upper case letter. For example:</p>

<pre>start == != start OP
</pre>

<p>When the scanner is in the base state of a rule and one of the patterns in
the list appears next in the input, the scanner moves past the matched
characters, and goes into the target state. The current token is terminated
after the matched characters and given that type. With the above rule, if the
scanner is in the <code>start</code> state and either of the equality operators
<code>==</code> or <code>!=</code> appears next in the input, then the scanner
moves past the operator, gives it the token type <code>OP</code>, and remains in
the <code>start</code> state.</p>

<p>A rule need not include a token type, in which case scanning of the current
token is continued. In the following example, when in the <code>start</code>
state, if a double quote character appears next in the input, the scanner moves
past it and goes into the <code>string</code> state to deal with the rest of the
token:</p>

<pre>start " string
</pre>

<p>A pattern in a rule must be non-empty and may not contain spaces, newlines,
control characters, or Unicode characters beyond ASCII. In a pattern, a
backslash followed by digits is an escape sequence giving the decimal numerical
code of an ASCII character. A backslash which is not followed by a digit has no
special meaning. A space can be written as <code>\32</code> and a newline can be
written as <code>\10</code> for example, as in:</p>

<pre>start \10 start NEWLINE
</pre>

<p>In awkward cases, e.g. matching a backslash followed by a digit in the input,
the matching can be done in two steps using an extra state. For example:</p>

<pre>start \ escape
escape 0..9 numericalEscape
</pre>

<p>Although non-ASCII characters cannot be included in patterns, they are
accepted in the text being scanned, and are implicitly treated the same as
letters. This covers most common cases where such characters are allowed by
programming languages, e.g. in comments, string literals or identifiers.</p>

<p>As an abbreviation, if a pattern consists of two characters separated
by two dots, it represents a range of one-character patterns, e.g.
<code>0..9</code> stands for <code>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</code>. For example:</p>

<pre>start 0..9 number
</pre>

<p>This rule says that if the scanner is in the <code>start</code> state, and a
digit appears next in the input, the scanner matches the digit and goes into the
<code>number</code> state. There is no token type, so the current token is not
terminated, and scanning of the token continues in the <code>number</code>
state, after the matched digit.</p>

<p>A limited form of lookahead is provided. A lookahead rule has a plus sign
character as a suffix of the token type. For example:</p>

<pre>note \10 start COMMENT+
</pre>

<p>This rule says that in the <code>note</code> state, which recognises a
one-line comment, if a newline appears next in the input text, the current token
at this point is terminated and given type <code>COMMENT</code>, without
including the newline. The scanner then goes into the <code>start</code> state
to deal with the newline.</p>

<p>A lookahead rule need not terminate the current token, i.e. it need not have
a token type. For example:</p>

<pre>start \ escape +
</pre>

<p>This says that in the <code>start</code> state, if a backslash occurs next in
the input, it is not immediately included in the current token. The scanner goes
into the target state <code>escape</code>, which is responsible for handling the
backslash.</p>

<p>A rule may have no patterns, in which case it is a default rule that applies
to anything that may appear next in the input. For example:</p>

<pre>id start ID+
</pre>

<p>This rule says that the current token should be terminated and given type
<code>ID</code>, no matter what appears next in the input. If the rule has no
lookahead flag, it applies to any single character. For example:</p>

<pre>start start ERROR
</pre>

<p>This marks any character appearing next in the input as a one-character token
of type <code>ERROR</code>.</p>

<p>If a lookahead rule with no patterns has no token type, it is effectively an
unconditional jump to another state. For example,</p>

<pre>directive start +
</pre>

<p>The <code>directive</code> state might be used to recognise a special
sequence of tokens. This rule says that if anything further appears in the
input, the scanner reverts to the <code>start</code> state to handle it.</p>

<h2>States</h2>

<p>A state is defined by the rules which have that state as their base state.
The rules defining a state don't have to be contiguous. For example, all the
rules relevant to each type of token may be gathered together, even though that
means the rules for the <code>start</code> state are scattered:</p>

<pre># One line comments
start // note
note \10 start COMMENT
note note

# Multi-line comments
start /* comment
comment */ start COMMENT
...
</pre>

<p>If the input matches a pattern mentioned in any one of the rules for a state,
that rule is applied. In the following example, in the <code>start</code> state,
if an equality operator appears next in the input, it is marked with type
<code>OP</code>, whereas if a letter appears, the scanner goes into the
<code>id</code> state:</p>

<pre>start == != start OP
start a..z A..Z id
</pre>

<p>If two different patterns match at one position in the input, the longer
pattern takes precedence. In this example, if there are two equal signs next in
the input, the second rule applies, not the first. If there is only a single
equal sign, the first rule applies:</p>

<pre>start = start SIGN
start == != start OP
</pre>

<p>If the same pattern is matched by multiple rules, the earlier rule takes
precedence. Thus later rules act as defaults and, even though the rules for a
state need not be contiguous, the order in which they appear in the description
file may matter. For example:</p>

<pre>string " start QUOTE
string start
</pre>

<p>These rules say that, while recognizing a string literal in double quotes, a
double quote character terminates the token, even though the double quote
character is also matched by the second rule, which acts as a default.</p>

<p>Since a token is not given a type until the end of the token is reached,
decisions about which type to use can be delayed. For example, rules like these
can be used for a language where an identifier is allowed to start with a
keyword:</p>

<pre>start a..z A..Z id
start if else for while key

key a..z A..Z 0..9 id
key start KEY

id a..z A..Z 0..9 id
id start ID
</pre>

<p>Suppose the keyword <code>for</code> appears next in the input. Since
<code>for</code> is longer than the single letter <code>f</code>, the second
rule for the <code>start</code> state applies rather than the first and the
scanner goes to the <code>key</code> state which gives the token the type
<code>KEY</code>.</p>

<p>Suppose instead that the identifier <code>form</code> appears next in the
input. The prefix <code>for</code> is matched and the scanner goes into the
<code>key</code> state. Then the <code>m</code> is matched and the scanner goes
into the <code>id</code> state and the token ends up being given type
<code>ID</code>.</p>

<h2>Correctness checks</h2>

<p>When a language description is processed, various checks are made for correct
behaviour. The checks ensure that the scanner never fails, creates non-empty
tokens, partitions the input by including every character in a token, handles
all possible inputs, and terminates without getting stuck in a loop.</p>

<p>Every target state mentioned in the rules must be a defined state, i.e. one
which appears as the base state of at least one rule.</p>

<p>Every state must handle all possible inputs. A check is made that each
possible single character which could appear next in the input is mentioned
explicitly or implicitly in the state's rules. The easiest way to ensure that is
for each state to have a final default rule which handles all cases not covered
in the previous rules. For example, a state for identifiers might have a default
rule which says that if anything other than a letter or digit appears next in
the input, the token is terminated:</p>

<pre>id a..z A..Z 0..9 id
id start ID+
</pre>

<p>Every state is classified either as a <dfn>starting</dfn> state, which the
scanner is in when between tokens, or a <dfn>continuing</dfn> state, which the
scanner is in when within a token. A check is made to ensure that each state is
consistently treated as one or the other.</p>

<p>The base state of the first rule in the description is the initial state of
the scanner, so it is a starting state. Any state which appears as the target in
a rule with a token type must also be a starting state. For example:</p>

<pre>start # hash SIGN
</pre>

<p>This rule might be used in the C language, to recognise preprocessor
directives such as <code>#include</code>. After the <code>#</code> token,
<code>include</code> is a keyword rather than an identifier. The
<code>hash</code> state is a starting state for recognising such keywords only
in this limited context. Another example is:</p>

<pre>html &lt;% java SIGN
java %> html SIGN
</pre>

<p>These rules might be used in a language such as <code>JSP</code> where html
text can contain Java program fragments between <code>&lt;%</code> and
<code>%></code> brackets. The <code>html</code> and <code>java</code> states are
starting states which recognize each of the two sublanguages.</p>

<p>An example where an error arises because states are not handled consistently
might be:</p>

<pre>dot 0..9 number
dot a..z A..Z prop SIGN+
dot start +

prop a..z A..Z 0..9 prop
prop start PROPERTY+
</pre>

<p>The idea behind these rules is that if a dot is followed by an identifier,
the identifier should be highlighted differently, as a <code>PROPERTY</code>.
However, the <code>prop</code> state is classified as a starting state, because
it follows the completion of a <code>SIGN</code> token in the second
<code>dot</code> rule. On the other hand, it appears to be a continuing state,
both because it is the target of its own first rule, and because it completes a
<code>PROPERTY</code> token in its second rule. This can be corrected by
writing:</p>

<pre>dot 0..9 number
dot propStart SIGN+

propStart a..z A..Z prop
propStart start +

prop a..z A..Z 0..9 prop
prop start PROPERTY+
</pre>

<p>Now, <code>prop</code> is a starting state which matches only the first
letter, and <code>prop2</code> is a continuing state which recognizes the rest
of the token.</p>

<p>If a lookahead rule has no token type, it makes no obvious immediate
progress, by moving forward in the input or by terminating a token, so there is
a check that there is no cycle of such rules which could result in an infinite
loop when scanning. For example:</p>

<pre>even a..z odd +
odd a..z even +
</pre>

<p>These rules would cause the scanner to continue indefinitely if a letter
appeared next in the input.</p>

<h2>Conventions</h2>

<p>The Snipe scanner does not just give each token a type for syntax
highlighting purposes. It also supports further editor features, and some
conventions are needed for this to work. Some of these conventions can be
checked when a language description is processed, and a warning message may be
issued if the checks fail.</p>

<p>One extended purpose for the scanner is to support commands that move the
cursor a 'word' at a time. That means a long comment or quoted literal should be
divided into mini-tokens. To ensure this, there is a check to make sure that
each newline, or sequence of one or more spaces, is treated as a token in its
own right. For example, a multi-line comment might be dealt with like this:</p>

<!--
<p>For every pattern in every non-lookahead rule, a newline should not appear
anywhere other than at the end of the pattern, and if it does appear, the rule
should have a token type to terminate the token. Then each line begins a new
token, and each line can be displayed independently.</p>

<p>For every pattern in every non-lookahead rule, a space should not appear in
the pattern unless the pattern is just a space, in which case the state should
be a starting state, and should accept only spaces before terminating the
current token. Thus whenever a space follows a non-space, or a non-space follows
a space, there is a token boundary.</p>
-->

<pre>start /* comment
comment \32 commentGap COMMENT+
comment \10 COMMENT
comment */ start COMMENT
comment comment
commentGap \32 commentGap
commentGap comment COMMENT
</pre>

<p>In these rules, a sequence of spaces, or a newline, is marked as a separate
token, so that the editor can recognise it and skip past it when moving a 'word'
at a time. A newline is marked as a <code>COMMENT</code> token rather than as a
<code>NEWLINE</code> token, to indicate to the editor that the following line
should not have automatic indenting rules applied.</p>

<p>The token type names are chosen so that each can be abbreviated as a single
character, to make tests more readable. The current set of token type names
is:</p>

<p class="indent"><code>BRACKET0 BRACKET1 BRACKET2 BRACKET3 BRACKET4 BRACKET5
BRACKET6 BRACKET7 BRACKET8 BRACKET9 COMMENT ERROR FUNCTION GAP ID KEY NEWLINE OP
PROPERTY QUOTE RESERVED SIGN TYPE VALUE</code></p>

<p>Each of these can be abbreviated unambiguously to its first character, except
for the bracket types which can be abbreviated to their suffix digit. The
bracket types are used to classify each bracket token, to support automatic
bracket matching. where the brackets are thought of as being listed in matching
pairs, in order of increasing priority. For example, for a curly bracket
language, brackets might be handled like this:</p>

<pre>start ( start BRACKET0
start ) start BRACKET1
start [ start BRACKET2
start ] start BRACKET3
start { start BRACKET4
start } start BRACKET5
</pre>

<p>In a language where keywords <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> are used
for blocks instead of curly brackets, the last two rules might instead be:</p>

<pre>start begin start BRACKET4
start end start BRACKET5
</pre>

<p>To support bracket matching, brackets which are inactive, because they are in
comments or quoted literals, should have other token types such as
<code>COMMENT</code> or <code>QUOTE</code>.</p>

<p>A typical test might appear something like this:</p>

<pre>struct *point = { x, (y+1) }; int ns = [(n+2),3];
K.....GSI....GSG4GISG0IOV1G5SGK..GI.GSG20IOV1SV3S
</pre>

<p>The first line represents some input text, and the line below represents the
result of scanning. The first character of each token is marked below by the
one-character abbreviation of its token type, and the remaining characters of a
token are marked by dots.</p>

<h2>Compiling...</h2>







<p>A language description in <code>tokens.txt</code> can be compiled into a table
using <code>compile.c</code> in <code>snipe/languages</code> and then executed
using <code>interpret.c</code>, independently of the rest of Snipe. The
interpreter carries out tests in a file <code>tests.txt</code>. Each test
consists of optional comment lines starting with <code>#</code>, followed by a
line of text, followed by a line of tags generated by the scanner. For
example:</p>

<p>Thus the type of a token may be affected by the next token, but no more than
that. To scan incrementally in the editor, when a token is altered, the editor
needs to go back at least as far as the beginning of the previous token before
the changed one, and find what state the scanner was in at that point, to start
re-scanning.</p>

<h3>Scanner operation</h3>

<p>The current state of the scanner can be recorded now and then, e.g. at the
start of each line of the text. Then, when some text changes while editing,
re-scanning of the changed text need begin no earlier than at the start of the
affected line. Re-scanning would then continue until synchronisation, i.e. until
the current state of the scanner at the start of a line matches the previous
state recorded at that point. It is desirable that this synchronisation should
happen after only a line or two, to avoid visual instability for the user as
well as inefficiency in the editor. Scanning is then effectively
incremental.</p>

<p>The first state to be defined in a language description is the default one
for the scanner to start in. It is normal for most tokens to be scanned starting
from that first state, with other states being defined to handle progression
through each token. In that case, re-scanning is sure to be brief. However,
alternative start states for tokens can be used to handle unusual
situations.</p>


<h2>Matching</h2>

<!-- Best approach for compactness: allocate 256 values 'dynamically' to both
"tag x overridden with tag y" pairs, and "scanner starting state x overridden
with space tag" and even "original indent x overridden with newline". Can we
work out from language definition whether we will run out? -->

<p>The way in which brackets and delimiters are matched for a language is
defined in a file <code>match.txt</code> in the language directory. A blank line
or a line starting with one or two symbols (e.g. <code>#</code> or
<code>//</code>) is a comment line. Each rule in the file begins with a
two-letter upper case keyword followed by triples of symbol tags, for
example:</p>

<pre>EQ (-) [-] {-} '=' "=" /*. &lt;*>
</pre>

<p>The first and third symbols in a triple are token type tags, as allocated in
the <code>tokens.txt</code> file. The first is an opener, i.e. the token type of
an opening bracket or delimiter, and the third is a closer. The middle symbol is
an operator such as a comparison which specifies what happens when the opener
and closer meet during matching. The <code>=</code> symbol indicates that the
opener and closer match. A rule with a minus sign as a tag (or no tag) specifies
that the openers and closers are brackets, and the token types of the tokens
between matching brackets remain unchanged. A rule may also deal with
mismatches:</p>

<pre>LT (?] [?}
</pre>

<p>This establishes a precedence between the brackets when they don't match, and
the token type given to any mismatched brackets. The triple <code>(&lt;]</code>
means that when <code>(</code> is the most recent open bracket and
<code>]</code> is the next close bracket, then the <code>(</code> is marked with
type <code>?</code> and subsequently ignored. Implicit further comparisons are
automatically deduced from the ones given, in this case:</p>

<pre>LT (?}
GT [?) {?) {?]
</pre>

<p>A suitable rules for quotes would be:</p>

<pre>EQ '=' "="
</pre>

<p>This establishes which quotes match, and specifies that the type
<code>=</code> (quoted text) overrides the original types of the quotes and the
tokens between them. A further rule might be:</p>

<pre>MM '?. "?.
</pre>

<p>This rule specifies that the quotes are on one line. The dot is the token
type of a newline, and <code>'?.</code> means that the opening quote and the
newline 'match'. Using <code>MM</code> instead of <code>EQ</code> means that a
different token type than the normal one for the opener can be used, in this
case the quoted text is tagged as an error.</p>

<p>Comments might be specified using:</p>

<pre>EQ #*. &lt;*>
</pre>

<p>This says that a one-line comment, where the opening delimiter has been
tagged with type <code>#</code>, is matched by the next newline and that all the
tokens making up the comment have their types overridden with <code>*</code>
(commented text). Assuming that multi-line comment delimiters have been given
types <code>&lt;</code> and <code>></code>, the triple <code>&lt;=></code> makes
them match.</p>

<p>In some languages multi-line comments nest, but in many others they don't. To
specify that multi-line comments nest, a rule like this can be used:</p>

<pre>PL &lt;*&lt; >*>
</pre>

<p>The PL operation refers to two openers or two closers to indicate that one
pair is allowed inside another. In the forward matching algorithm, the triple
<code>&lt;*&lt;</code> indicates that when <code>&lt;</code> is on the stack of
unmatched openers, and a further <code>&lt;</code> is encountered, it is pushed
onto the stack. To specify instead that multi-line comments are non-nesting,
rules like this can be used:</p>

<pre>GT &lt;*&lt; >?>
</pre>

<p>The first rule indicates that, when scanning forwards, a later
start-of-comment token is mismatched, but tagged as commented text rather than
as an error. When scanning backwards, an earlier end-of-comment token takes
precedence and the later one is tagged as an error.</p>

<h3>Example: reinterpretation</h3>

<p>In C or a similar language, the text <code>"*/"//"</code> would be
scanned as something like:</p>

<pre>"*/"//"
">-"#-"
</pre>

<p>After scanning, if there is no multiline comment in progress at the start of
the sequence, the first two quotes are matched, the one-line comment delimiter
is matched with the end of the line, and the tags are temporarily overridden
as:</p>

<pre>"*/"//"
==-=*-*
</pre>

<p>On the other hand, if a multiline comment is in progress, it ends at the
<code>*/</code> delimiter, the last two quotes are matched, and the phrase is
instead temporarily overridden as:</p>

<pre>"*/"//"
**-====
</pre>

<p>If bracket matching is incremental as well as scanning, then these
readjustments can also be incremental, and the whole process need not be very
expensive.</p>

<p>TODO: explain forward algorithm. Assume only brackets. As well as text, there
are two stacks: unmatched and matched. (Picture with ... for cursor position.)
The unmatched stack contains indexes of currently unmatched open brackets (as
standard). The matched stack contains matched (open,close) pairs of indexes. The
indexes of the close brackets are in text order. Changes as you add or remove a
bracket at the cursor are very small and incremental and efficient.  Two
mismatched brackets are treated as matched, except that they are both
highlighted as invalid. Incremental.</p>

<p>TODO: explain backward algorithm. Entirely symmetrical. Note that the indexes
are measured leftwards from the end of the text, so that they remain stable as
insertions and deletions happen at the cursor.</p>

<p>TODO: explain inwards algorithm. The two stacks are compared inwards.
Mismatching pairs are highlighted red. Remaining surplus brackets are
highlighted red. Give examples showing 'just typed' effects.</p>

<p>TODO: explain delimiters. Not same because (a) they are usually not nested
and (b) they may be limited to one line (c) open and close may be the same or
there may not be an explicit closer and (d) they affect the highlighting of the
tokens in between. Nested comments same as brackets, non-nested comments more
interesting. When inside a comment, an open comment delimiter is always the top
opener on the unmatched stack. Ordinary tokens are included in algorithm, and
have their highlighting overridden as you go past them, according to the top
opener, but they don't end up on either stack. Unnested algorithm described
below. Multiline literal (often """) similar, also unnested (can't nest if start
and end delimiter are the same). Describe quotes and forward and backward.
Describe one-line comment (memo). Must wait until found and then re-mark to end
of line - not purely local but not bad.</p>

<p>After scanning into tokens, a matching algorithm is used to pair up brackets
and delimiters. Some aims of the Snipe approach are to:</p>

<ul>
<li>highlight unmatched brackets and delimiters</li>
<li>have small edits produce small changes</li>
<li>make the algorithm incremental</li>
</ul>

<p>If brackets don't match, there is an ambiguity about which brackets to mark
as unmatched. For example, the sequence <code>(()</code> can be treated in
either of these two ways:</p>

<pre class="match">(<b>(</b>)
<b>(</b>()
</pre>

<p>In the first case, the outer brackets are matched and the inner one is
highlighted as unmatched. In the second case, the rightmost brackets are
matched, and the leftmost one is marked as unmatched.</p>

<p>If the user has just typed one of the two open brackets, that is the one that
is most intuitively highlighted as unmatched. That suggests a matching algorithm
based on the user's history. However, that would make it awkward to save and
reopen files, and it could easily become counter-intuitive.</p>

<p>Instead, Snipe uses a matching strategy which is based purely on the text
together with the user's current cursor position. Brackets are matched forwards
from the start of the text up to the cursor, and backwards from the end of the
text to the cursor. Surplus brackets on either side of the cursor are then
matched up from outermost to innermost. Using three dots to mark the cursor
position, the three brackets above are handled like this:</p>

<style>
pre.match { color: black; }
pre.match i { color:black; font-style: normal; background-color: lightgrey; }
pre.match b { color: red; }
pre.match u { color: green; text-decoration: none; }
</style>

<pre class="match">(<b>(</b><u>...</u>)
<b>(</b><u>...</u>()
</pre>

<p>In the first case, there are two surplus brackets before the cursor and one
after, and the outermost two are matched. In the second case, there are no
surplus brackets after the cursor, so the leftmost bracket is mismatched.</p>

<p>The situation is complicated by multiline comments. Let's suppose that they
are delimited by <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> and that these don't nest,
as in many C-like languages. These comments cause two main problems. One is that
commenting out goes wrong when there is an inner comment. The other is that
inserting or deleting a comment delimiter can cause a large amount of text to be
re-scanned, which is sometimes inefficient enough to cause a noticeable and
irritating delay. In any case, it causes a large amount of changed highlighting
on screen, which can be annoying.</p>

<p>The approach in Snipe, to avoid these problems, is to treat <code>/*</code>
as illegal inside comments (as <code>*/</code> already is) and, as with
brackets, use both forward and backward matching. In addition, the effect of an
unmatched comment delimiter only extends as far as the cursor. For example:</p>

<pre class="match"><i>/*...<b>/*</b>...*/</i>...<b>*/</b>
<b>/*</b>...<i>/*...<b>*/</b>...*/</i>
</pre>

<p>In the first case, the cursor is beyond the text fragment. The first and
third delimiters are matched, and the text between is highlighted as a comment.
The second and fourth delimiters are highlighted as unmatched. This is as
expected, except for the highlighting of the second delimiter.</p>

<p>In the second case, the cursor is before the text fragment. Working
backwards, the fourth and second delimiters are matched, with the text between
them highlighted as a comment, leaving the third and first delimiters unmatched.
Although this highlighting doesn't agree with the language conventions, it is a
reasonable approach once internal delimiters are regarded as invalid, and the
need for correction is clearly indicated.</p>

<p>To see the full effect on highlighting, here is a sequence of user actions in
which an attempt is made to comment out some text which already contains a
comment:</p>

<pre class="match"><u>:</u>...<i>/*...*/</i>...
<i><b>/*</b></i><u>:</u>...<i>/*...*/</i>...
<i><b>/*</b>...</i><u>:</u><i>/*...*/</i>...
<i>/*...<b>/*</b></i><u>:</u><i>...*/</i>...
<i>/*...<b>/*</b>...</i><u>:</u><i>*/</i>...
<i>/*...<b>/*</b>...</i><i>*/</i><u>:</u>...
<i>/*...<b>/*</b>...</i><i>*/</i>...<u>:</u>
<i>/*...<b>/*</b>...</i><i>*/</i>...<b>*/</b><u>:</u>
</pre>

<p>At the first step, an opening delimiter is typed. At the second, the cursor
is moved past some text, which becomes highlighted as comment. Then the cursor
is moved past the second opening delimiter, which becomes highlighted as
unmatched. The first and third delimiters match, as surplus delimiters either
side of the cursor. Then the cursor is moved past some text which is unchanged,
and a final delimiter is typed, which is immediately highlighted as
unmatched.</p>

<p>During the sequence, the only changes on the screen are immediately adjacent
to the cursor, with possibly one change of highlighting to a delimiter further
away. And the changes are, arguably, very intuitive.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>Can bracket/delimiter matching be defined in a custom way too?</p>

<pre>Brackets, in increasing priority order
M () [] {} &lt;> (match, mismatch and excess ? Covers PU, MA, EX, LT, GT
S ~)? ~]? ~}? (start excess)
G {] {) [)
L (] (} [}
Quote delimiters (match with morph)
M ''=  ""=  @@=
M '.? ".?   (mismatch both, implicitly not NL)
One-line delimiters terminated at NL
Don't need GL rules because first=last
Since . ends ' and " and // backward matching needs retro morph
Comment delimiters
D #.*  /\*  (i.e. // ends at \n and /* ends at */)
G //?       (i.e. /* /* mismatch R)
X ^^
/* /* GT   but  {- {- = PU
</pre>

<pre>M = start of text
() = Rr   [] = Aa  {} = Ww
'"T = QDT  // = C  /**/ = Xx   {--} = Yy

// Make sure tags have no override flags when not on any of the stacks.
// (Note indent MAYBE grapheme continuation of preceding NL).
enum action {
    XX,  // Not relevant.
    PU,  // push next onto openers, then check it against closers
    MA,  // match with popped opener, push pair onto matched
    EX,  // excess: mark next as mismatched  (EQUALS G ???)
    LT,  // less: pop and mismatch opener, repeat
    GT,  // mismatch next (and push on matched ???)
    IN,  // incomplete (same as LT, but don't touch NL ???)

    CO,  // skip, and override as commented
