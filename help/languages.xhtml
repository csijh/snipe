<h1>Languages</h1>

<p><mark>Snipe</mark> has a scanner used to divide the text of a file being
edited into tokens, and to give each token a type. The scanner is table-driven,
using a language description from a text file. Further languages can be
supported by adding description files.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>A scanner for an editor has different goals from those of a scanner in a
compiler. On the one hand:</p>

<ul>
<li>it may omit some details needed only for full compiling</li>
<li>it may accept some tokens that a compiler would reject</li>
<li>it may split or classify tokens differently</li>
<li>it may not need to be completely accurate</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand:</p>

<ul>
<li>it must include all characters, including comments, in
tokens</li>
<li>it must be able to handle any text, whether valid or not, and never
fail</li>
<li>it must produce token types which are suitable for syntax
highlighting</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the scanner for Snipe has some further specific features:</p>

<ul>
<li>it avoids re-scanning large quantities of text</li>
<li>it produces mini tokens within comments and literals</li>
<li>it supports word-based cursor movement and line wrapping</li>
<li>it helps with automatic indenting, bracket matching, semicolon insertion</li>
<li>it supports incremental algorithms</li>
</ul>

<p>In most editors, when a multi-line comment delimiter such as <code>/*</code>
is typed, it causes a large quantity of text to be re-scanned as a single big
comment token, possibly to the end of the file. Then, when the matching close
comment delimiter is typed, much of the text is re-scanned again, reversing the
effect. This is inefficient, which could lead to noticeable delays, and also
causes large changes on screen, which can be disconcerting.</p>

<p>To avoid this, and support an incremental approach in which small edits have
small effects, the Snipe scanner divides the text into smaller tokens than
usual. These small tokens then support word-based cursor movement and line
wrapping within comments or literals. Bracket matching techniques which take the
current cursor position into account are used to match up comment and literal
delimiters, and re-interpret the tokens between them. Auto indenting and other
features are similarly handled in an incremental fashion.</p>

<h2>Tokens</h2>

<p>Language tokens are described by a plain text file. For example, the C
language is described by the <code>rules.txt</code> file in the directory
<code>snipe/languages/c</code>. The file is a description of a string-matching
state machine. A generic scanner uses the state machine to generate a tag byte
for every byte of text.</p>

<p>The format of language description files is fairly simple. A line which
doesn't begin with a lower case letter (e.g. a blank line or a line starting
with <code>#</code>) is a comment line which is ignored. Otherwise, a line
represents a string matching rule, for example:</p>

<pre>start == != start OP
</pre>

<p>A rule consists of a base state name, a list of pattern strings to match, a
target state name, and an optional token type, all separated by spaces. A state
name must begin with a lower case letter. The first rule in the description
determines the initial state of the scanner.</p>

<p>When the scanner is in the base state of a rule and one of the strings in the
list is matched, the scanner moves past the matched string in the input, and
goes into the target state. If there is a tag representing a token type, the
token is terminated after the matched characters and given that type. If there
is no token type, scanning of the current token is continued.</p>

<p>With the above rule, if the scanner is in the <code>start</code> state and
either of the equality symbols <code>==</code> or <code>!=</code>  appears next,
then the scanner moves past the symbol, gives it the token type
<code>OP</code>, and remains in the <code>start</code> state.</p>

<p>A pattern string in a rule is plain text. There are no quoting or escape
conventions. A pattern may not contain spaces, newlines, control characters, or
non-ASCII characters. However, non-ASCII Unicode characters are allowed in the
text being scanned, and are treated the same as letters. This covers most common
cases where such characters are allowed by programming languages, in comments,
strings or identifiers. Spaces and newlines cannot be matched explicitly. A
token is always terminated at a space or newline, and the scanner deals with any
sequence of spaces or newlines before entering the next target state.</p>

<p>As an abbreviation, if a pattern string consists of two characters separated
by two dots, it represents a range of one-character strings, e.g.
<code>0..9</code> stands for <code>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</code>. For example:</p>

<pre>start 0..9 number
</pre>

<p>This rule says that if the scanner is in the <code>start</code> state, and a
digit appears next in the input, the scanner matches the digit and goes into the
<code>number</code> state. There is no token type attached to the rule, so the
current token is not terminated, and scanning of the token continues.</p>

<p>If a pattern has a question mark attached at the end, the pattern string is
matched, but not included in the token. (A question mark on its own is a normal
pattern.) The rule must have a token type in this case. This provides a limited
lookahead facility. For example:</p>

<pre>id (? start FUNCTION
</pre>

<p>This rule says that if an open bracket appears next in the input text, a
non-empty identifier at this point is terminated and marked as a function
without including the bracket. The scanner then goes to the <code>start</code>
state. There may be spaces between the end of the token and the open bracket.
Thus the type of a token may be affected by the next token, but no more than
that. To scan incrementally in the editor, when a token is altered, the editor
needs to go back at least as far as the beginning of the previous token before
the changed one, and find what state the scanner was in at that point, to start
re-scanning.</p>

<p>There may be multiple rules for the same state. If a string mentioned in any
one of the rules matches, that rule is applied. For example:</p>

<pre>start == != start OP
start a..z A..Z id
</pre>

<p>In the start state, if an equality symbol appears next in the input, it is
marked as an operator token. If a letter appears, the scanner moves to the
<code>id</code> state.</p>

<p>If two different strings match at one position in the input, the longer
string takes precedence. For example:</p>

<pre>start = start SIGN
start == != start OP
</pre>

<p>If there are two equal signs next in the input, the second rule applies, not
the first. If there is only a single equal sign, the first rule applies.</p>

<p>If the same string is mentioned in multiple rules, the earlier rule takes
precedence. Thus later rules act as defaults. For example:</p>

<pre>filename > start VALUE
filename !..~ filename
</pre>

<p>These rules say that, while recognizing a filename in <code>&lt;...></code>
brackets as a single token, a <code>></code> character terminates the token,
even though the <code>></code> is also matched by the second rule. The pattern
<code>!..~</code> in the second rule represents all printable ASCII characters,
so if any character other than <code>></code> is matched, the token is
continued.</p>

<p>If a rule has no pattern strings at all, it matches the empty string, and so
defines a default action to be taken if nothing else matches, or if the input
position is at the end of the text. For example, the last rule for identifiers
could be:</p>

<pre>id start ID
</pre>

<p>A default rule like this is an implicit lookahead rule. It is roughly
equivalent to:</p>

<pre>id !..~? start ID
</pre>

<p>This says that if any printable character not already matched appears next in
the input, the token is terminated without including it. The difference between
this and a default rule with no patterns is that a default rule also implicitly
applies to spaces and newlines. To scan text without failing, every state should
have a default rule, to make sure that all situations are covered.</p>

<p>Since a token is not marked until the end of the token is reached, decisions
about which type to use can be delayed. For example, rules like these can be
used for a language where an identifier is allowed to start with a keyword:</p>

<pre>start a..z A..Z id
start if else for while key

key a..z A..Z 0..9 id
key start KEY

id a..z A..Z 0..9 id
id start ID
</pre>

<p>Suppose the keyword <code>for</code> appears next in the input. Since
<code>for</code> is longer than the single letter <code>f</code>, the second
rule for the <code>start</code> state applies rather than the first. Then, in
the <code>key</code> state, if the keyword is followed by a letter or digit,
<code>form</code> for example, the scanner goes into the <code>id</code> state
and the token ends up being marked as an identifier. Otherwise, <code>for</code>
is marked as a keyword.</p>

<p>A token type may be a name starting with an upper case letter. Any names can
be used, but only the first letter is significant. Typical names might be:</p>

<pre>ESCAPE FUNCTION ID KEY OP PROPERTY RESERVED SIGN TYPE VALUE
</pre>

<p>For example, <code>ESCAPE</code> might be used for any escape sequence such
as <code>\n</code> forming a token on its own whether or not it appears inside
quotes. The first letter of the name is used to determine syntax
highlighting.</p>

<p>Alternatively, a token type may be a symbol consisting of a single printable
but non-alphanumeric ASCII character. A symbol indicates a token type which has
a significance in Snipe beyond syntax highlighting. The symbols and their
meanings are:</p>

<pre>(   Open level 0 bracket
)   Close level 0 bracket
[   Open level 1 bracket
]   Close level 1 bracket
{   Open level 2 bracket
}   Close level 2 bracket
#   Start of one-line comment, e.g. # or //
&lt;   Start of multiline comment delimiter (non-nesting), e.g. /*
>   End of multiline comment delimiter (non-nesting), e.g. */
^   Start of multiline comment delimiter (nesting), e.g. {-
$   End of multiline comment delimiter (nesting), e.g. -}
*   Tokens inside (any kind of) comment
'   Single quote delimiter
"   Double quote delimiter
@   Multiline quote delimiter, e.g. """
=   Tokens inside (any kind of) quotes
:   Label indicator (affects indenting)
?   Invalid, incomplete, mismatched or unwise token
.   Newline (delimits one-line comments or incomplete quotes)
~   Continuation byte of Unicode character, or start of joiner
-   Continuation character of token
_   Space
</pre>

<p>The last four symbols are handled automatically by the scanner, and used as
tags for bytes other than the first byte of a token. They cannot appear
explicitly in language description rules.</p>

<p>In awkward cases, it may be necessary to choose an imperfect compromise. Take
a file inclusion in C for example:</p>

<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</pre>

<p>In this context only, following a <code>#</code> sign, the word
<code>include</code> is a keyword rather than an identifier, and the
<code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> signs act as string quotes round a file
path rather than as comparison operators. Technically, the string can contain
spaces, but that would involve treating the string as multiple tokens and
handling <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> in some language-dependent way
during a later delimiter matching algorithm. To avoid that, the rules for the C
language could include these:</p>

<pre>start # hash1 SIGN
...

hash1 include hash2 KEY
...

hash2 &lt; hash3
...

hash3 &gt; start =
hash3 !..~ hash3
hash3 start ?
...
</pre>

<p>This treats <code>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> as a single token, without spaces,
tagged with <code>=</code> to indicate quoted (or <code>?</code> to indicate
incomplete). A file path containing spaces in this context is vanishingly rare,
and the only consequence is incorrect syntax highlighting on one line.</p>

<p>As well as making sure that scanning cannot fail, it is also important to
make sure that it always makes progress, without getting stuck in a loop. To
ensure this, the initial state should normally include a rule such as:</p>

<pre>start !..~ start ?
</pre>

<p>This ensures that any character not previously matched is treated as a
one-character token and marked as invalid. Then all the states are classified as
start states or continue states. A start state is one which is the target of a
rule which terminates a token, and therefore can be the active state at the
start of the next token. Any rule which contains a lookahead token with a
question mark suffix is then checked to make sure that its target is the initial
state, or a state with a similar catch-all rule to accept all characters. That
way, all rules progress, either by moving forward in the input, or by
terminating a non-empty token.</p>

<p>A language description in <code>rules.txt</code> can be compiled into a table
using <code>compile.c</code> in <code>snipe/languages</code> and then executed
using <code>interpret.c</code>, independently of the rest of Snipe. The
interpreter carries out tests in a file <code>tests.txt</code>. Each test
consists of optional comment lines starting with <code>#</code>, followed by a
line of text, followed by a line of tags generated by the scanner. For
example:</p>

<pre># Check brackets
struct *point = { x, (y+1) }; int ns = [(n+2),3];
K-----_SI----_S_{_IS_(ION)_}S_K--_I-_S_[(ION)SN]S.
</pre>

<h3>Scanner operation</h3>

<p>The current state of the scanner can be recorded now and then, e.g. at the
start of each line of the text. Then, when some text changes while editing,
re-scanning of the changed text need begin no earlier than at the start of the
affected line. Re-scanning would then continue until synchronisation, i.e. until
the current state of the scanner at the start of a line matches the previous
state recorded at that point. It is desirable that this synchronisation should
happen after only a line or two, to avoid visual instability for the user as
well as inefficiency in the editor. Scanning is then effectively
incremental.</p>

<p>The first state to be defined in a language description is the default one
for the scanner to start in. It is normal for most tokens to be scanned starting
from that first state, with other states being defined to handle progression
through each token. In that case, re-scanning is sure to be brief. However,
alternative start states for tokens can be used to handle unusual
situations.</p>


<h3>Example: reinterpretation</h3>

<p>In C or a similar language, the text <code>"*/"//"</code> would be
scanned as something like:</p>

<pre>" QUOTE */ COMMENT " QUOTE // COMMENT " QUOTE
</pre>

<p>After scanning, if there is no multiline comment in progress at the start of
the sequence, the first two quotes are matched, the one-line comment delimiter
is matched with the end of the line, and the sequence is temporarily adjusted
to:</p>

<pre>" QUOTE */ QUOTE " QUOTE // COMMENT " COMMENT
</pre>

<p>On the other hand, if a multiline comment is in progress, it ends at the
<code>*/</code> delimiter, the last two quotes are matched, and the phrase is
instead temporarily adjusted to:</p>

<pre>" COMMENT */ COMMENT " QUOTE // QUOTE " QUOTE
</pre>

<p>If bracket matching is incremental as well as scanning, then these
readjustments can also be incremental, and the whole process need not be very
expensive.</p>

<h2>Matching</h2>

<p>TODO: explain forward algorithm. Assume only brackets. As well as text, there
are two stacks: unmatched and matched. (Picture with ... for cursor position.)
The unmatched stack contains indexes of currently unmatched open brackets (as
standard). The matched stack contains matched (open,close) pairs of indexes. The
indexes of the close brackets are in text order. Changes as you add or remove a
bracket at the cursor are very small and incremental and efficient.  Two
mismatched brackets are treated as matched, except that they are both
highlighted as invalid. Incremental.</p>

<p>TODO: explain backward algorithm. Entirely symmetrical. Note that the indexes
are measured leftwards from the end of the text, so that they remain stable as
insertions and deletions happen at the cursor.</p>

<p>TODO: explain inwards algorithm. The two stacks are compared inwards.
Mismatching pairs are highlighted red. Remaining surplus brackets are
highlighted red. Give examples showing 'just typed' effects.</p>

<p>TODO: explain delimiters. Not same because (a) they are usually not nested
and (b) they may be limited to one line (c) open and close may be the same or
there may not be an explicit closer and (d) they affect the highlighting of the
tokens in between. Nested comments same as brackets, non-nested comments more
interesting. When inside a comment, an open comment delimiter is always the top
opener on the unmatched stack. Ordinary tokens are included in algorithm, and
have their highlighting overridden as you go past them, according to the top
opener, but they don't end up on either stack. Unnested algorithm described
below. Multiline literal (often """) similar, also unnested (can't nest if start
and end delimiter are the same). Describe quotes and forward and backward.
Describe one-line comment (memo). Must wait until found and then re-mark to end
of line - not purely local but not bad.</p>

<p>After scanning into tokens, a matching algorithm is used to pair up brackets
and delimiters. Some aims of the Snipe approach are to:</p>

<ul>
<li>highlight unmatched brackets and delimiters</li>
<li>have small edits produce small changes</li>
<li>make the algorithm incremental</li>
</ul>

<p>If brackets don't match, there is an ambiguity about which brackets to mark
as unmatched. For example, the sequence <code>(()</code> can be treated in
either of these two ways:</p>

<pre class="match">(<b>(</b>)
<b>(</b>()
</pre>

<p>In the first case, the outer brackets are matched and the inner one is
highlighted as unmatched. In the second case, the rightmost brackets are
matched, and the leftmost one is marked as unmatched.</p>

<p>If the user has just typed one of the two open brackets, that is the one that
is most intuitively highlighted as unmatched. That suggests a matching algorithm
based on the user's history. However, that would make it awkward to save and
reopen files, and it could easily become counter-intuitive.</p>

<p>Instead, Snipe uses a matching strategy which is based purely on the text
together with the user's current cursor position. Brackets are matched forwards
from the start of the text up to the cursor, and backwards from the end of the
text to the cursor. Surplus brackets on either side of the cursor are then
matched up from outermost to innermost. Using three dots to mark the cursor
position, the three brackets above are handled like this:</p>

<style>
pre.match { color: black; }
pre.match i { color:black; font-style: normal; background-color: lightgrey; }
pre.match b { color: red; }
pre.match u { color: green; text-decoration: none; }
</style>

<pre class="match">(<b>(</b><u>...</u>)
<b>(</b><u>...</u>()
</pre>

<p>In the first case, there are two surplus brackets before the cursor and one
after, and the outermost two are matched. In the second case, there are no
surplus brackets after the cursor, so the leftmost bracket is mismatched.</p>

<p>The situation is complicated by multiline comments. Let's suppose that they
are delimited by <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> and that these don't nest,
as in many C-like languages. These comments cause two main problems. One is that
commenting out goes wrong when there is an inner comment. The other is that
inserting or deleting a comment delimiter can cause a large amount of text to be
re-scanned, which is sometimes inefficient enough to cause a noticeable and
irritating delay. In any case, it causes a large amount of changed highlighting
on screen, which can be annoying.</p>

<p>The approach in Snipe, to avoid these problems, is to treat <code>/*</code>
as illegal inside comments (as <code>*/</code> already is) and, as with
brackets, use both forward and backward matching. In addition, the effect of an
unmatched comment delimiter only extends as far as the cursor. For example:</p>

<pre class="match"><i>/*...<b>/*</b>...*/</i>...<b>*/</b>
<b>/*</b>...<i>/*...<b>*/</b>...*/</i>
</pre>

<p>In the first case, the cursor is beyond the text fragment. The first and
third delimiters are matched, and the text between is highlighted as a comment.
The second and fourth delimiters are highlighted as unmatched. This is as
expected, except for the highlighting of the second delimiter.</p>

<p>In the second case, the cursor is before the text fragment. Working
backwards, the fourth and second delimiters are matched, with the text between
them highlighted as a comment, leaving the third and first delimiters unmatched.
Although this highlighting doesn't agree with the language conventions, it is a
reasonable approach once internal delimiters are regarded as invalid, and the
need for correction is clearly indicated.</p>

<p>To see the full effect on highlighting, here is a sequence of user actions in
which an attempt is made to comment out some text which already contains a
comment:</p>

<pre class="match"><u>:</u>...<i>/*...*/</i>...
<i><b>/*</b></i><u>:</u>...<i>/*...*/</i>...
<i><b>/*</b>...</i><u>:</u><i>/*...*/</i>...
<i>/*...<b>/*</b></i><u>:</u><i>...*/</i>...
<i>/*...<b>/*</b>...</i><u>:</u><i>*/</i>...
<i>/*...<b>/*</b>...</i><i>*/</i><u>:</u>...
<i>/*...<b>/*</b>...</i><i>*/</i>...<u>:</u>
<i>/*...<b>/*</b>...</i><i>*/</i>...<b>*/</b><u>:</u>
</pre>

<p>At the first step, an opening delimiter is typed. At the second, the cursor
is moved past some text, which becomes highlighted as comment. Then the cursor
is moved past the second opening delimiter, which becomes highlighted as
unmatched. The first and third delimiters match, as surplus delimiters either
side of the cursor. Then the cursor is moved past some text which is unchanged,
and a final delimiter is typed, which is immediately highlighted as
unmatched.</p>

<p>During the sequence, the only changes on the screen are immediately adjacent
to the cursor, with possibly one change of highlighting to a delimiter further
away. And the changes are, arguably, very intuitive.</p>

<!--




<p>The token types are:</p>

<pre>BAD
COMMENT  (0=/*, 1=*/, 2, 3)
ESCAPE sequence
HANDLE (colon)
IDENTIFIER (0,1,2,3,4 for normal, function, property, method, constant)
KEYWORD (0,1 for alternative highlighting, e.g. reserved)
LEFT (0,1,2)
LINE
MEMO  (//)
NUMBER
OP
PARAGRAPH (e.g. """)
RIGHT (3,4,5)
QUOTE (0,1 for " ')
SIGN (symbol e.g. = , ;)
TYPE
WORD

order: LINE, BAD, MEMO, QUOTE first.
important for bracketing: LINE BAD MEMO QUOTE BRACKET COMMENT
</pre>

<p>All actions other than accept terminate the current token with a type. Upper
case letters are used to mark tokens which only affect syntax highlighting via
theme files. Non-letter symbols are used to mark tokens which have some
syntactic significance which potentially affects bracketing, indenting,
continuation, wrapping etc. Bracket matching in the editor deals with such
things as delimiting comments and quoted literals, terminating one-line comments
at newlines, or marking a close curly bracket as belonging to an initializer
(which affects the handling of semicolons). That means, for example, that a
newline should be marked with <code>$</code> so that the bracket matcher can
detect the end of a one-line comment.</p>

<p>A language description file has tests at the end, after a line of at least
five minus signs. Each test consists of two lines of text. Tests may be
separated by blank lines. The first line of a test consists of some program text
in the language being described. The second line shows the token types generated
by the scanner. The first character of a token is marked with its type, and the
remaining characters of a token are marked with spaces.</p>

<p>The scanner is made incremental by generating tags which encode both the
token type and the state which the scanner is in after the token. A token cannot
be affected by anything further ahead than the following character. So, after an
edit, rescanning can be started at the nearest token boundary before the edit
point, and stopped as soon as a token after any changed text is given the same
tag as before the edit.</p>
