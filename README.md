# Snipe

Snipe is a cross-platform, fast-loading, programmer's editor. It's aim is to
implement basic features well, rather than to provide sophistication. The
current version is 0.1 which is for beta testing. It is very basic, and lacks
extensive testing.

- [Release 0.1](https://github.com/csijh/snipe/releases/tag/v0.1)

Only Linux and Windows binary zip files are currently provided. For MacOS or
for a platform where the binary doesn't work, compile from source.

To install, download the zip file and unzip. You can double click on the
executable, or on the help index file. Put the installation directory in your
path so you can launch the editor from anywhere. In the editor, type CTRL+H to
open the help documentation. The available key and mouse gestures can be
gleaned from files/map.txt.
