Ops
---
An op (edit or fix) is offered to:
text, lines, cursors, history/undo, style/hightlights (after), brackets
An op is offered to these, to generate fixes:
trail, indent, semis

Trail
-----
User ins or del. Need (one) character beyond s to check.
Check if any characters are now spaces at end of line.
Check if newline at end of text.
Check if causes blank lines at end of text.
Where put the fix ops?

Refactor
--------
text (just gap-buffer, maybe with newline conventions).
history (edits passed on)
lines
cursors (does own repairs)
style (points to lines, text, scanner, auto-full-repair on edit)
brackets (needs style and lines of text)

Lines
-----
scan-state and semicolon-flags are fixed amounts.
so is indent-amount, but not indent-brackets.

Style changes.
--------------
NEED Open, Close, Bad. Bad needs to be an O/C flag.
Remove START in favour of MORE.
Add BAD as a genuine flag?
Do POINT/SELECT some other way, or as now.
Use names to indicate simulated defaults:
HOW tell the indenter to switch off inside comments?
MAYBE it is enough for the indenter to look for a first COMMENT token.
(Note Open_COMMENT, OPEN_NOTE should be indented correctly.)

SIGN
OPEN_SIGN  (_1, _2, ... ?)
CLOSE_SIGN
LABEL_SIGN
OP_SIGN
OPEN_COMMENT ?
CLOSE_COMMENT
KEY
OPEN_KEY
CLOSE_KEY  (how pair up?) (maybe OPEN_KEY2...)
TYPE_KEY
PROPERTY_KEY
NAME_WORD
ID_WORD
VARIABLE_WORD
FIELD_WORD
FUNCTION_WORD
NOTE_COMMENT

Could just have "default = previous", but can't skip.

Distinct:
Gap, Word, Key, Sign, Literal, Comment
Flags:
Alt1, Alt2, Alt3, Alt4, Alt5, Open, Close, Bad
