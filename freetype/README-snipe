This is a cut-down version of freetype 2.9 suitable for static linking.  The
modules.cfg file has been modified, and many files deleted, to remove support
for everything except ttf font files and. In particular, there are no
dependencies on platforms and other libraries. To rebuild, type this in the
freetype directory:

    rm objs/*
    make setup ansi
    make
